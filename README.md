# THE-IMPACT-OF-CORRECTIVE-MAINTENANCE-PRACTICES-ON-STUDENT-S-HEALTH-IN-AHMADU-BELLO-UNIVERSITY-KADUNA
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project aims to examine the critical link between corrective maintenance practices in university hostels and their impact on student health. The research, conducted at Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, focuses on how delays and deficiencies in maintenance systems contribute to specific health risks among student residents. The project aims to provide an evidence-based analysis to inform policy and procedural changes that enhance student well-being.

## OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of this research were to:
-	Analyze the impact of corrective maintenance practices on student health outcomes.
-	Evaluate the perceived effectiveness of existing maintenance procedures within the hostels.
-	Assess the level of awareness among students regarding the health implications of poor living conditions.
-	Provide actionable recommendations to mitigate health risks and improve maintenance efficiency.

## DATA SOURCE
The data was collected through a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data.
-	Primary Data: This was the main source of information, gathered through structured questionnaires administered to 99 students residing in selected hostels at ABU, Zaria, and interviews with 5 maintenance staff members. The high response rate of 100% from both groups ensures the data is comprehensive and representative of the surveyed populations.
-	Secondary Data: The study also drew upon existing literature, reports, and academic papers on facilities management, public health, and university infrastructure in Nigeria.

## TOOLS
The following tools and methods were utilized for data collection and analysis:
•	Structured Questionnaires(GOOGLE FORM): These were the primary instruments for gathering quantitative data from students. The questionnaires were designed to capture perceptions on maintenance timeliness, health risks, and behavioral responses.
•	Interviews: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with maintenance staff to gain a deeper understanding of operational challenges, resource limitations, and their awareness of the health implications of their work.
•	Statistical Software(MICROSOFT EXCEL): Data was processed and analyzed using statistical software to generate descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, tables, and charts.

## METHODOLOGY
- Data Collection
The data collection process involved two distinct phases: surveying students and interviewing maintenance staff. Questionnaires were distributed to a stratified sample of students across four different hostels to ensure representation. Simultaneously, maintenance staff responsible for these hostels were interviewed to corroborate student reports and provide insights into systemic challenges.
- Data Preparation and Cleaning
Once collected, the raw data from the questionnaires were compiled into a spreadsheet. The data was then cleaned by removing rows with incomplete responses to ensure consistency and accuracy, with each entry verified to prevent errors. 
Data Visualization
- Visual representations were crucial for communicating the findings. Tables and charts were generated to illustrate key metrics, such as the demographic breakdown of respondents, student perceptions of repair timeliness, and the prevalence of reported health risks.

## EDA (EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS)
The exploratory data analysis revealed several key patterns and insights. 
The majority of student respondents were male (61%), with a significant portion residing in ICSA Hostel (37%), followed by Danfodio Hostel (26%). This distribution was designed to capture a broad range of maintenance conditions.
The analysis of student and staff perceptions of maintenance timeliness highlighted a significant discrepancy between expectation and reality. For example, a combined 41.98% of students strongly agreed that repairs are often delayed, while a combined 65.45% of staff also acknowledged significant delays. This consensus from both parties underscores a systemic problem.

## RESULTS AND INSIGHT
The study's findings provide compelling evidence that delayed corrective maintenance poses a significant and tangible threat to student health.
- Health Impacts: There is a strong consensus (with a combined Strongly Agree and Agree response rate often exceeding 40% for each category) that poor maintenance contributes directly to diseases. Notably, malaria (11.28%), fungal infections (10.94%), and sick building syndrome (10.78%) were identified as the most prevalent health risks stemming from maintenance deficiencies.
- Maintenance Gaps: The data points to critical issues in the maintenance process itself. Student perceptions revealed a profound lack of follow-up on reported issues, with 43.43% stating it "never" occurs. Staff interviews corroborated this, highlighting problems with resource allocation and slow response times, particularly for critical issues like electrical and plumbing repairs.
- Behavioral Patterns: The research identified a passive behavioral trend among students. While some personal measures were taken, institutional engagement (e.g., reporting issues or participating in health programs) was minimal, indicating a breakdown in the communication loop between residents and the maintenance department.

## RECOMMENDATION
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are proposed to enhance student health and improve maintenance efficiency:
1.	Establish a Proactive Maintenance Culture: The university should shift from a reactive, corrective maintenance model to a proactive, preventive one. This involves implementing a scheduled maintenance program for all hostel infrastructure to identify and address potential issues before they become health hazards.
2.	Enhance Resource Allocation: The university administration must increase the allocation of financial and material resources to the maintenance department. This includes ensuring a consistent supply of essential repair materials and modernizing equipment.
3.	Improve Communication and Feedback Loops: A robust, transparent, and user-friendly system for reporting and tracking maintenance issues should be implemented. This system should provide students with real-time updates and ensure that reported issues are acknowledged and resolved promptly.
4.	Launch Targeted Health Awareness Programs: The university should conduct health campaigns to educate students on the specific health risks associated with a poorly maintained environment. This will empower students to take more effective personal measures and report issues more consistently.

## CONCLUSION
This project clearly demonstrates that the current reliance on delayed and inadequate corrective maintenance practices in university hostels creates a hazardous environment for students. The strong correlation between maintenance deficiencies and prevalent health issues such as malaria and fungal infections highlights a critical public health concern within the university community. By adopting a proactive maintenance strategy, enhancing resource allocation, and improving communication, the university can significantly mitigate these risks and ensure a healthier, more conducive living and learning environment for its students.
